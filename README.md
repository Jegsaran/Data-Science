  Machine Learning
  
      Car Price Prediction - 
                             A model to predict the price of cars with the available independent variables using various statistical analysis tools. 
                             The model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market in USA.
                             
      Loan Default Probability -
                             A bank had collected data about historical loan default along with respective information for each member.                                
                             Built a model that will help this bank by predicting the probability that a member will default.
                             
      Telecom Customer Churning - 
                            A telecom company had collected data about historical churning along with respective information for each member.
                            Built a model that will help this firm by predicting the Churning rate and areas to prevent from happening.
                            
      Tractor Sales Prediction - 
                            Developed an ARIMA model to forecast sale / demand of tractor for next 3 years. Additionally, We will also investigate the 
                            impact of marketing program on sales by using an exogenous variable ARIMA model.
